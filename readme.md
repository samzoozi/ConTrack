# ConTrack
ConTrack is a scalable concept tracking model, which cam track multiple concepts and participation of multiple actors in each concept over time, in high dimensional temporal data. 

The detailed information about the model is provided in the forllowing paper:
Zonoozi, Ali, et al. "ConTrack: A Scalable Method for Tracking Multiple Concepts in Large Scale Multidimensional Data." Data Mining (ICDM), 2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on. IEEE, 2016.

 
 
The model runs on "Petuum" distributed framerwork (https://www.petuum.com/), which requires Gradle (https://gradle.org) to be installed as the automation and compilation toolkit.
